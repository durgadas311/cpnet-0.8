# cpnet-0.8
## Hector Peraza's Unix/Linux CP/NET server

I have not yet found an established maintainer or devleopment contact
for the "cpnet-0.8.tgz" code. As such, I've imported the code into
a github project and have begun development.

First feature was to get the server working when "stdio" is selected
as the device. This allows easier use from within emulations/simulations.

Second feature was to support some special "proxy" messages used
by cpnet-z80 clients, in order to support those clients with this
server.

See also [the official documentation](README).
