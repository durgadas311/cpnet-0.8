The official source repo is located at

All changes have been merged.

=====

First feature was to get the server working when "stdio" is selected
as the device. This allows easier use from within emulations/simulations.

Second feature was to support some special "proxy" messages used
by cpnet-z80 clients, in order to support those clients with this
server.

See also [the official documentation](README).
